Tomorrow, tomorrow, and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace from day to day to the last syllable of recorded time, and all our yesterdays are lighted fools the way to dusty death. Out, Out brief candle. Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and is heard no more.
